Our project is worth 100 points because it is awesome. We incorporated some cool CSS3 styles such as the title moving and rotating and also the gif background. We created a game that is pretty challenging to play and at times gave us a hard time to code. The trickiest part of this game was detecting the collisions between the three types of circles and also the zombie circles chasing the player. It required us to think back to our days of trig and also to think of some good ideas involving how the movement of the player should be. We decided not to use any libraries because we could get the job done using just HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
